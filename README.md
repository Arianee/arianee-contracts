## Arianee Contracts

<p align="center">
    <b>The @arianee/contracts repository houses the smart contracts that drive the Arianee Protocolâ€”a decentralized, open-source solution for creating tokenized digital product passports. While these contracts are central to the protocol, they represent only part of its broader infrastructure. Built on a multi-EVM foundation, the protocol empowers brands to manage product identities, track lifecycle events, and directly engage with product owners.</b>

## Key Features

- **Events Timestamping**: Enriching NFT metadata throughout its lifecycle allows the NFT to evolve alongside the customer journey, ideal for applications like e-maintenance booklets.
- **Decentralized Messaging**: Enabling secure, zero-party data exchanges between brands and consumers through on-chain mechanisms.
- **Privacy**: Protecting brands off and on-chain data through zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy-enhancing technologies.
- **Transfer Permit**: A Smart Asset Sharing Token that delegates marketplace rights for seamless digital product passport transfers post-sale, enhancing transaction fluidity for sellers, buyers, and marketplaces alike.
